        <p class="repentance">
          Repentance is a profound act of remorse and transformation. 
          It involves acknowledging one's wrongdoing, feeling genuine regret, 
          and making a firm commitment to change. Repentance requires a deep
           examination of our actions and their consequences, along with a sincere 
           desire for redemption. It is a process that calls for humility, honesty,
            and self-reflection. Through repentance, we confront our flaws, seek forgiveness
             from those we have harmed, and strive to make amends. It is a powerful catalyst
              for personal growth and moral development.
           Repentance allows us to break free from the chains of guilt and shame, paving 
           the way for healing, reconciliation, and the possibility of a better future.
